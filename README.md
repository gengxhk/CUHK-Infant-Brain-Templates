# CUHK-Infant-Brain-Templates

This project aimed to construct MRI structural infant brain templates for Chinese babies aged from 0 to 3 months old. A total of 112 babies from 6 to 89 days of age were included. Both t1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI data were used to build brain templates using an unbiased registration approach. The template construction and evaluation procedure can be referred by Geng et al. (2023). 

Both overall and age-specific templates were constructed for babies aged at 0, 1, 2, and 3 months old. These templates can be used for investigating birth related conditions such as preterm birth, detecting neural biomarkers for neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders in Chinese populations, and exploring genetic and cultural effects on the brain.
